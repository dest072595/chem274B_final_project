- Report/
- Include/
- Source/
- Source/Datatypes/ (place here your Graph data structures)
- Source/Math (place here your matrix-matrix sequential and parallel
  implementations)
- Tests/ (test the functionality you develop)
- Utils/ (include some relevant utilities from previous modules)

LIST OF FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY:

- README (this file - make sure you add your own comments here)
- Makefile: <students create makefiles for Assignment 4>
- ethane.txt - test file #1 for problem 1
- octane.txt - test file #2 for problem 1

# - Students need to also place their Answers-Assignment4.pdf
